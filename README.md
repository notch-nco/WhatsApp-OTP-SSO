# WhatsApp-OTP-SSO
WhatsApp OTP SSO enables seamless phone number verification via WhatsApp without requiring a PIN. A predefined code is generated in-memory within the mobile app, then users are redirected to WhatsApp to send it. The code is later validated by the backend API, ensuring secure and hassle-free authentication.
