## WhatsApp-OTP-SSO


WhatsApp OTP SSO enables seamless phone number verification via WhatsApp without requiring a PIN. A predefined code is generated in-memory within the mobile app, then users are redirected to WhatsApp to send it. The code is later validated by the backend API, ensuring secure and hassle-free authentication.

**4. Plugin Diagram**

**Message Generation:**  
• The plugin generates a pre-filled WhatsApp verification message, using the (WhatsAppUrlGenerator) class. This ensures the message includes all necessary information (e.g., OTP or verification code).  

• The URL for the message is created using the (IUrlGenerationService) and parsed via the (IParsingUriService) to ensure compatibility with the WhatsApp URL scheme.  

**WhatsApp Launching:**  
• Once the URL is prepared, the (WhatsAppLauncherService) attempts to launch the native WhatsApp app. This opens WhatsApp directly, pre-filled with the verification message.  

**Platform Support:**  
• The plugin is cross-platform and works on both Android and iOS devices.  

**Status Feedback:**  
**• Success:** If WhatsApp launches successfully, the plugin notifies the app via a callback, enabling the user to proceed with verification.  

**• Failure:** If WhatsApp fails to launch, the plugin notifies the app and prompts the user with an error message (e.g., "Failed to launch WhatsApp").
